    ### Store the configuration data to the local variables

    nol = config[1]                # Maximum number of overlaps

    ### Explaination of the variable naming
    #
    # c Cell
    # p (cell) Pair
    # t (cell) Tripel (pairwise overlapping)
    # a contact arc candidate
    # f free closure arc
    #
    # i,j,k,l  # cell indices
    # m,mm,... # overlapping cell pair indices
    # n,nn,... # overlap triple (or vertex) indices
    # o,oo,... # pseudo vertex indices
    # p,pp,... # Voronoi arc indices
    # q,qq,... # free, marginal arc indices

    # Realting and linking the various involved objects
    # Cells -> Pairs, Triples
    c2a = np.zeros((cm, nol))      # Indices of the Voronoi arcs around cell
    c2p = np.zeros((cm, nol))      # indices of pairs containing cell
    c2am = np.zeros((1, cm))       # Num of Voronoi arcs around a cell
    c2pm = np.zeros((1, cm))       # Num of pairs containing a cell

    # Pair -> Cells, Triples, Vertices
    pm = 0                         # Num of pairs
    p2s = np.zeros((nol*cm, 7))    # Contact Sphere variables
